# Ebolution BaseCrudModule

Provides a functional base to create CRUD modules

All use cases and controllers are meant to be extended by child modules to provide full basic CRUD operations on 
custom entities.

For examples on how to use this module, check the code in this module: 
[Base CRUD Module Scaffold](https://github.com/ebolution/laravel-base-crud-module-scaffold), used as base to 
replicate and make all the modifications needed to meet your requirements.

The easiest way to start working with this module is by installing 
[Base CRUD Module Creator](https://github.com/ebolution/laravel-base-crud-module-creator), and following its 
instructions.
